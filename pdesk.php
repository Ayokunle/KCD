                                    Dear Beloved, </br>
                                    I would like to extend this open invitation from our lord Jesus Christ to you today. 
                                    It is very possible that you have received the invitation before but have not acted on it up to this moment. 
                                    However, it is also possible that the invitation has not reached you at all. 
                                    Whichever is the case, today, I am extending His invitation to you. 
                                    Indeed, I personally count it a great priviledge to be invited by the King of kings Himself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our Lord Jesus Christ gave an open invitation to all in Mathew 11: 28 that I am extending to you today if you would honour it. 
                                    He says, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest” (KJV). 
                                    What does it means to be heavily laden? Laden, means to be burdened, weighed down or overloaded. 
                                    What burdens are you bearing today? 
                                    What is weighing you down? 
                                    I am aware that there are many issues of life that is weighing many of us down at the moment that have defied human solutions. 
                                    Many are being weighed down by their financial situations. 
                                    Some are being weighed down by lack of jobs. 
                                    Others are weighed down by emotional issues of life or relational breakdown. 
                                    However, the good news is that He is able to give you rest from any burden if only you would come to Him. 
                                    In Jeremiah 31:25 He says “I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint." (NIV)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It may look too simplistic because the issues may have defied all solutions, advice and counselling that you have undertaken in 
                                    the past, that may have led you to resign yourself to fate or concluded that there is no way out. 
                                    This is where the invitation of our Lord Jesus Christ becomes relevant. 
                                    If other human efforts have failed, I would want to encourage you to try divine solution. 
                                    I can tell you that though man may fail, Jesus Christ can never fail. Why? 
                                    He cannot fail because in Numbers 23:19 it is written “God is not a man, so he does not lie. 
                                    He is not human, so he does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act? 
                                    Has he ever promised and not carried it through?” (NLT). So, when He gave the invitation, He meant what He says. 
                                    Quite unlike men, He gave the invitation because He knows His plans for us. 
                                    His plan through the invitation is that we may have peace. 
                                    I am sure anyone who is weighed down cannot be said to have peace.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I want to challenge you today to accept His invitation and you would be amazed about the transformation that would 
                                    take place in your life. 
                                    If you would like to accept the invitation today I would ask you to pray this prayer. 
                                    ‘Lord Jesus, I come before you today to confess that thus far I have led my life without you, but today 
                                    I am accepting your invitation and now confess you as my Lord and Saviour. I want you to rule my life from now on. 
                                    I pray that you forgive my sins and blot out my sins with your blood and write my name in the Book of life. 
                                    Help me not to go back to my sins. Thank you Lord Jesus for saving my soul from perishing. Amen’.
                                </p>
